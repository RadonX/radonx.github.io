1. [zurb/foundation-sites: The most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. Quickly create prototypes and production code for sites that work on any kind of device.](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites)

3. [Building Blocks | ZURB Library](http://zurb.com/building-blocks)

   Templates here are very useful.
   But there seems to be a major update of Foundation 6.x compared to Foundation 5.x.
   Some of the templates are based on old version.
   Apply right version of `basic[-5.5.3].html` to play with the demos.
