# Daily Reset, Idle Reset, and Compaction

This note explains the core lifecycle events of an OpenClaw session: automatic resets (daily and idle) and context compaction. It clarifies their purpose, triggers, and effects on session history and memory.

---
## User's Core Questions

> - "但是像 Thread 这种模型的话，会不会因为对话太短，从来没有触发 compaction 而导致记忆没有被提炼呢？"
> - "每日重置时reset的是纯文件session logs? 还是会实打实地影响LLM context？"
> - "那设置闲置超时还有意义吗？它不还是会被‘每日重置’？"
> - "Session log 是append only 的吗？还是会随着compaction创建新session？"
> - "我这两天读了一下OpenClaw 代码，发现它每过 idle reset time 会自动/new新对话。我感觉这个机制不太合理。"

> 主 session 的“压缩=compaction”以及“压缩前记忆提取=pre-compaction memory flush”，**本质都是对某一个 sessionKey 的生命周期管理**。subagent 因为有自己独立的 sessionKey，所以结论是：**subagent 也会走 compaction/flush 机制，但只作用在它自己的 subagent session 上；并且通常很少发生，因为 subagent 会话往往很短、还会自动归档**。> > 下面给你证据点 + 用大白话总结。> > ---> > ## 1) Subagent 是独立 session（所以 compaction 当然也独立）> **证据：** `docs/tools/subagents.md`> > > “They run in their own session (`agent:<agentId>:subagent:<uuid>`) …”> > 因此 subagent 的历史、压缩摘要等，都是写在它自己的 `agent:...:subagent:...` 那份 transcript 里，不会影响主 session。> > ---> > ## 2) Compaction 是“写入该 session 的 JSONL 历史”的摘要条目> **证据：** `docs/concepts/compaction.md`> > > “Compaction **summarizes older conversation** … The summary is stored in the session history…”  > > “Compaction **persists** in the session’s JSONL history.”> > 所以如果 subagent 的 session 足够长到触发 compaction，它也会把“压缩摘要”写进**subagent 那条 JSONL**。> > ---> > ## 3) “压缩前记忆提取（silent memory flush）”也是 per-session 的> **证据：** `docs/concepts/session.md`（Pre-compaction memory flush）> > > “When a session nears auto-compaction, OpenClaw can run a **silent memory flush** turn…”> > 这句话没有限定“只有 main session”，所以逻辑上它是**任何 session**在接近自动压缩时都会走的机制（前提是 workspace 可写、且该 session 真的接近 compaction）。> > ---> > ## 4) 但 subagent 实际上经常“来不及压缩/提取”就被归档了> **证据：** `docs/tools/subagents.md`> > > “Sub-agent sessions are automatically archived after `agents.defaults.subagents.archiveAfterMinutes` (default: 60).”> > subagent 常见用法是：做一个任务就结束，文本量不大；再加上默认 60 分钟自动归档，所以绝大多数 subagent session **不会长到触发 compaction**。> > ---> > ## 5) 一个关键差异：subagent 的 system prompt 是 minimal，默认不带“Memory Recall”那套提示> 你提到的“记忆会被提取”，如果你指的是那种“提醒模型把 durable notes 写到 disk/记忆文件”的行为，subagent 的提示词模式会更瘦。> > **证据：** `docs/concepts/system-prompt.md`> > > “`minimal`: used for sub-agents; omits **Skills**, **Memory Recall**, … and **Heartbeats**.”> > 意思是：subagent 运行时默认系统提示更短，**不会像主会话那样强调 Memory Recall/心跳等流程**。  > 但“pre-compaction memory flush”是 runtime 机制，是否触发取决于实现/配置与 session 是否接近压缩；并不是“提示词里写了才会发生”的那种完全软行为。> > ---> > ### 用一句话回答你的问题> - **subagent 的 session 也会被压缩**（如果足够长），压缩摘要只存在于 subagent 自己的 transcript。  > - **subagent 也可能触发压缩前的 memory flush**，但现实中不常见，因为 subagent 通常短且会自动归档。  > - 而且 subagent 的 promptMode=minimal，默认不走“主会话那套记忆召回/提示”流程。> > 你这句“记忆会被提取”具体是指：> 1) compaction summary（压缩摘要写回 session）  > 还是  > 2) pre-compaction memory flush（提醒写 durable notes 到 disk/记忆文件）？> > 你确认一下你问的是哪一个，我可以把答案进一步精确到“subagent 会不会写入 MEMORY.md / memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md”这种层级。

Do not block execution.> > ### 1) Establish context (read-only)> > Try to infer 1–5 from the environment before asking. Prefer simple, non-technical questions if you need confirmation.> > Determine (in order):> > 1. OS and version (Linux/macOS/Windows), container vs host.> 2. Privilege level (root/admin vs user).> 3. Access path (local console, SSH, RDP, tailnet).> 4. Network exposure (public IP, reverse proxy, tunnel).> 5. OpenClaw gateway status and bind address.> 6. Backup system and status (e.g., Time Machine, system images, snapshots).> 7. Deployment context (local mac app, headless gateway host, remote gateway, container/CI).> 8. Disk encryption status (FileVault/LUKS/BitLocker).> 9.

Prefer leaving them off, especially in group chats.> - **Fast path:** command-only messages from allowlisted senders are handled immediately (bypass queue + model).> - **Group mention gating:** command-only messages from allowlisted senders bypass mention requirements.> - **Inline shortcuts (allowlisted senders only):** certain commands also work when embedded in a normal message and are stripped before the model sees the remaining text.>   - Example: `hey /status` triggers a status reply, and the remaining text continues through the normal flow.> - Currently: `/help`, `/commands`, `/status`, `/whoami` (`/id`).> - Unauthorized command-only messages are silently ignored, and inline `/...` tokens are treated as plain text.> - **Skill commands:** `user-invocable` skills are exposed as slash commands. Names are sanitized to `a-z0-9_` (max 32 chars); collisions get numeric suffixes (e.g. `_2`).>   - `/skill <name> [input]` runs a skill by name (useful when native command limits prevent per-skill commands).>   - By default, skill commands are forwarded to the model as a normal request.>   - Skills may optionally declare `command-dispatch: tool` to route the command directly to a tool (deterministic, no model).> --> - Config is validated before write; invalid changes are rejected.> - `/config` updates persist across restarts.> > ## Surface notes> > - **Text commands** run in the normal chat session (DMs share `main`, groups have their own session).> - **Native commands** use isolated sessions:>   - Discord: `agent:<agentId>:discord:slash:<userId>`>   - Slack: `agent:<agentId>:slack:slash:<userId>` (prefix configurable via `channels.slack.slashCommand.sessionPrefix`)>   - Telegram: `telegram:slash:<userId>` (targets the chat session via `CommandTargetSessionKey`)> - **`/stop`** targets the active chat session so it can abort the current run.> - **Slack:** `channels.slack.slashCommand` is still supported for a single `/openclaw`-style command. If you enable `commands.native`, you must create one Slack slash command per built-in command (same names as `/help`). Command argument menus for Slack are delivered as ephemeral Block Kit buttons.

> ---> name: healthcheck> description: Host security hardening and risk-tolerance configuration for OpenClaw deployments. Use when a user asks for security audits, firewall/SSH/update hardening, risk posture, exposure review, OpenClaw cron scheduling for periodic checks, or version status checks on a machine running OpenClaw (laptop, workstation, Pi, VPS).> ---> > # OpenClaw Host Hardening> > ## Overview> > Assess and harden the host running OpenClaw, then align it to a user-defined risk tolerance without breaking access. Use OpenClaw security tooling as a first-class signal, but treat OS hardening as a separate, explicit set of steps.> > ## Core rules> > - Recommend running this skill with a state-of-the-art model (e.g., Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2+). The agent should self-check the current model and suggest switching if below that level; do not block execution.> - Require explicit approval before any state-changing action.> - Do not modify remote access settings without confirming how the user connects.> - Prefer reversible, staged changes with a rollback plan.> - Never claim OpenClaw changes the host firewall, SSH, or OS updates; it does not.> - If role/identity is unknown, provide recommendations only.> - Formatting: every set of user choices must be numbered so the user can reply with a single digit.> - System-level backups are recommended; try to verify status.> > ## Workflow (follow in order)> > ### 0) Model self-check (non-blocking)> > Before starting, check the current model. If it is below state-of-the-art (e.g., Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2+), recommend switching. Do not block execution.> > ### 1) Establish context (read-only)> > Try to infer 1–5 from the environment before asking. Prefer simple, non-technical questions if you need confirmation.> > Determine (in order):> > 1. OS and version (Linux/macOS/Windows), container vs host.> 2. Privilege level (root/admin vs user).> 3. Access path (local console, SSH, RDP, tailnet).> 4. Network exposure (public IP, reverse proxy, tunnel).> 5. OpenClaw gateway status and bind address.> 6. Backup system and status (e.g., Time Machine, system images, snapshots).> 7. Deployment context (local mac app, headless gateway host, remote gateway, container/CI).> 8. Disk encryption status (FileVault/LUKS/BitLocker).> 9. OS automatic security updates status.>    Note: these are not blocking items, but are highly recommended, especially if OpenClaw can access sensitive data.> 10. Usage mode for a personal assistant with full access (local workstation vs headless/remote vs other).> > First ask once for permission to run read-only checks. If granted, run them by default and only ask questions for items you cannot infer or verify. Do not ask for information already visible in runtime or command output. Keep the permission ask as a single sentence, and list follow-up info needed as an unordered list (not numbered) unless you are presenting selectable choices.> > If you must ask, use non-technical prompts:> > - “Are you using a Mac, Windows PC, or Linux?”> - “Are you logged in directly on the machine, or connecting from another computer?”> - “Is this machine reachable from the public internet, or only on your home/network?”> - “Do you have backups enabled (e.g., Time Machine), and are they current?”> - “Is disk encryption turned on (FileVault/BitLocker/LUKS)?”> - “Are automatic security updates enabled?”> - “How do you use this machine?”>   Examples:>   - Personal machine shared with the assistant>   - Dedicated local machine for the assistant>   - Dedicated remote machine/server accessed remotely (always on)>   - Something else?> > Only ask for the risk profile after system context is known.> > If the user grants read-only permission, run the OS-appropriate checks by default. If not, offer them (numbered). Examples:> > 1. OS: `uname -a`, `sw_vers`, `cat /etc/os-release`.> 2. Listening ports:>    - Linux: `ss -ltnup` (or `ss -ltnp` if `-u` unsupported).>    - macOS: `lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN`.> 3. Firewall status:>    - Linux: `ufw status`, `firewall-cmd --state`, `nft list ruleset` (pick what is installed).>    - macOS: `/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate` and `pfctl -s info`.> 4. Backups (macOS): `tmutil status` (if Time Machine is used).> > ### 2) Run OpenClaw security audits (read-only)> > As part of the default read-only checks, run `openclaw security audit --deep`. Only offer alternatives if the user requests them:> > 1. `openclaw security audit` (faster, non-probing)> 2. `openclaw security audit --json` (structured output)> > Offer to apply OpenClaw safe defaults (numbered):> > 1. `openclaw security audit --fix`> > Be explicit that `--fix` only tightens OpenClaw defaults and file permissions. It does not change host firewall, SSH, or OS update policies.> > If browser control is enabled, recommend that 2FA be enabled on all important accounts, with hardware keys preferred and SMS not sufficient.> > ### 3) Check OpenClaw version/update status (read-only)> > As part of the default read-only checks, run `openclaw update status`.> > Report the current channel and whether an update is available.> > ### 4) Determine risk tolerance (after system context)> > Ask the user to pick or confirm a risk posture and any required open services/ports (numbered choices below).> Do not pigeonhole into fixed profiles; if the user prefers, capture requirements instead of choosing a profile.> Offer suggested profiles as optional defaults (numbered). Note that most users pick Home/Workstation Balanced:> > 1. Home/Workstation Balanced (most common): firewall on with reasonable defaults, remote access restricted to LAN or tailnet.> 2. VPS Hardened: deny-by-default inbound firewall, minimal open ports, key-only SSH, no root login, automatic security updates.> 3. Developer Convenience: more local services allowed, explicit exposure warnings, still audited.> 4. Custom: user-defined constraints (services, exposure, update cadence, access methods).> > ### 5) Produce a remediation plan> > Provide a plan that includes:> > - Target profile> - Current posture summary> - Gaps vs target> - Step-by-step remediation with exact commands> - Access-preservation strategy and rollback> - Risks and potential lockout scenarios> - Least-privilege notes (e.g., avoid admin usage, tighten ownership/permissions where safe)> - Credential hygiene notes (location of OpenClaw creds, prefer disk encryption)> > Always show the plan before any changes.> > ### 6) Offer execution options> > Offer one of these choices (numbered so users can reply with a single digit):> > 1. Do it for me (guided, step-by-step approvals)> 2. Show plan only> 3. Fix only critical issues> 4. Export commands for later> > ### 7) Execute with confirmations> > For each step:> > - Show the exact command> - Explain impact and rollback> - Confirm access will remain available> - Stop on unexpected output and ask for guidance> > ### 8) Verify and report> > Re-check:> > - Firewall status> - Listening ports> - Remote access still works> - OpenClaw security audit (re-run)> > Deliver a final posture report and note any deferred items.> > ## Required confirmations (always)> > Require explicit approval for:> > - Firewall rule changes> - Opening/closing ports> - SSH/RDP configuration changes> - Installing/removing packages> - Enabling/disabling services> - User/group modifications> - Scheduling tasks or startup persistence> - Update policy changes> - Access to sensitive files or credentials> > If unsure, ask.> > ## Periodic checks> > After OpenClaw install or first hardening pass, run at least one baseline audit and version check:> > - `openclaw security audit`> - `openclaw security audit --deep`> - `openclaw update status`> > Ongoing monitoring is recommended. Use the OpenClaw cron tool/CLI to schedule periodic audits (Gateway scheduler). Do not create scheduled tasks without explicit approval. Store outputs in a user-approved location and avoid secrets in logs.> When scheduling headless cron runs, include a note in the output that instructs the user to call `healthcheck` so issues can be fixed.> > ### Required prompt to schedule (always)> > After any audit or hardening pass, explicitly offer scheduling and require a direct response. Use a short prompt like (numbered):> > 1. “Do you want me to schedule periodic audits (e.g., daily/weekly) via `openclaw cron add`?”> > If the user says yes, ask for:> > - cadence (daily/weekly), preferred time window, and output location> - whether to also schedule `openclaw update status`> > Use a stable cron job name so updates are deterministic. Prefer exact names:> > - `healthcheck:security-audit`> - `healthcheck:update-status`> > Before creating, `openclaw cron list` and match on exact `name`. If found, `openclaw cron edit <id> ...`.> If not found, `openclaw cron add --name <name> ...`.> > Also offer a periodic version check so the user can decide when to update (numbered):> > 1. `openclaw update status` (preferred for source checkouts and channels)> 2. `npm view openclaw version` (published npm version)> > ## OpenClaw command accuracy> > Use only supported commands and flags:> > - `openclaw security audit [--deep] [--fix] [--json]`> - `openclaw status` / `openclaw status --deep`> - `openclaw health --json`> - `openclaw update status`> - `openclaw cron add|list|runs|run`> > Do not invent CLI flags or imply OpenClaw enforces host firewall/SSH policies.> > ## Logging and audit trail> > Record:> > - Gateway identity and role> - Plan ID and timestamp> - Approved steps and exact commands> - Exit codes and files modified (best effort)> > Redact secrets. Never log tokens or full credential contents.> > ## Memory writes (conditional)> > Only write to memory files when the user explicitly opts in and the session is a private/local workspace> (per `docs/reference/templates/AGENTS.md`). Otherwise provide a redacted, paste-ready summary the user can> decide to save elsewhere.> > Follow the durable-memory prompt format used by OpenClaw compaction:> > - Write lasting notes to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.> > After each audit/hardening run, if opted-in, append a short, dated summary to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`> (what was checked, key findings, actions taken, any scheduled cron jobs, key decisions,> and all commands executed). Append-only: never overwrite existing entries.> Redact sensitive host details (usernames, hostnames, IPs, serials, service names, tokens).> If there are durable preferences or decisions (risk posture, allowed ports, update policy),> also update `MEMORY.md` (long-term memory is optional and only used in private sessions).> > If the session cannot write to the workspace, ask for permission or provide exact entries> the user can paste into the memory files.>

> ---> name: healthcheck> description: Host security hardening and risk-tolerance configuration for OpenClaw deployments. Use when a user asks for security audits, firewall/SSH/update hardening, risk posture, exposure review, OpenClaw cron scheduling for periodic checks, or version status checks on a machine running OpenClaw (laptop, workstation, Pi, VPS).> ---> > # OpenClaw Host Hardening> > ## Overview> > Assess and harden the host running OpenClaw, then align it to a user-defined risk tolerance without breaking access. Use OpenClaw security tooling as a first-class signal, but treat OS hardening as a separate, explicit set of steps.> > ## Core rules> > - Recommend running this skill with a state-of-the-art model (e.g., Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2+). The agent should self-check the current model and suggest switching if below that level; do not block execution.> - Require explicit approval before any state-changing action.> - Do not modify remote access settings without confirming how the user connects.> - Prefer reversible, staged changes with a rollback plan.> - Never claim OpenClaw changes the host firewall, SSH, or OS updates; it does not.> - If role/identity is unknown, provide recommendations only.> - Formatting: every set of user choices must be numbered so the user can reply with a single digit.> - System-level backups are recommended; try to verify status.> > ## Workflow (follow in order)> > ### 0) Model self-check (non-blocking)> > Before starting, check the current model. If it is below state-of-the-art (e.g., Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2+), recommend switching. Do not block execution.> > ### 1) Establish context (read-only)> > Try to infer 1–5 from the environment before asking. Prefer simple, non-technical questions if you need confirmation.> > Determine (in order):> > 1. OS and version (Linux/macOS/Windows), container vs host.> 2. Privilege level (root/admin vs user).> 3. Access path (local console, SSH, RDP, tailnet).> 4. Network exposure (public IP, reverse proxy, tunnel).> 5. OpenClaw gateway status and bind address.> 6. Backup system and status (e.g., Time Machine, system images, snapshots).> 7. Deployment context (local mac app, headless gateway host, remote gateway, container/CI).> 8. Disk encryption status (FileVault/LUKS/BitLocker).> 9. OS automatic security updates status.>    Note: these are not blocking items, but are highly recommended, especially if OpenClaw can access sensitive data.> 10. Usage mode for a personal assistant with full access (local workstation vs headless/remote vs other).> > First ask once for permission to run read-only checks. If granted, run them by default and only ask questions for items you cannot infer or verify. Do not ask for information already visible in runtime or command output. Keep the permission ask as a single sentence, and list follow-up info needed as an unordered list (not numbered) unless you are presenting selectable choices.> > If you must ask, use non-technical prompts:> > - “Are you using a Mac, Windows PC, or Linux?”> - “Are you logged in directly on the machine, or connecting from another computer?”> - “Is this machine reachable from the public internet, or only on your home/network?”> - “Do you have backups enabled (e.g., Time Machine), and are they current?”> - “Is disk encryption turned on (FileVault/BitLocker/LUKS)?”> - “Are automatic security updates enabled?”> - “How do you use this machine?”>   Examples:>   - Personal machine shared with the assistant>   - Dedicated local machine for the assistant>   - Dedicated remote machine/server accessed remotely (always on)>   - Something else?> > Only ask for the risk profile after system context is known.> > If the user grants read-only permission, run the OS-appropriate checks by default. If not, offer them (numbered). Examples:> > 1. OS: `uname -a`, `sw_vers`, `cat /etc/os-release`.> 2. Listening ports:>    - Linux: `ss -ltnup` (or `ss -ltnp` if `-u` unsupported).>    - macOS: `lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN`.> 3. Firewall status:>    - Linux: `ufw status`, `firewall-cmd --state`, `nft list ruleset` (pick what is installed).>    - macOS: `/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate` and `pfctl -s info`.> 4. Backups (macOS): `tmutil status` (if Time Machine is used).> > ### 2) Run OpenClaw security audits (read-only)> > As part of the default read-only checks, run `openclaw security audit --deep`. Only offer alternatives if the user requests them:> > 1. `openclaw security audit` (faster, non-probing)> 2. `openclaw security audit --json` (structured output)> > Offer to apply OpenClaw safe defaults (numbered):> > 1. `openclaw security audit --fix`> > Be explicit that `--fix` only tightens OpenClaw defaults and file permissions. It does not change host firewall, SSH, or OS update policies.> > If browser control is enabled, recommend that 2FA be enabled on all important accounts, with hardware keys preferred and SMS not sufficient.> > ### 3) Check OpenClaw version/update status (read-only)> > As part of the default read-only checks, run `openclaw update status`.> > Report the current channel and whether an update is available.> > ### 4) Determine risk tolerance (after system context)> > Ask the user to pick or confirm a risk posture and any required open services/ports (numbered choices below).> Do not pigeonhole into fixed profiles; if the user prefers, capture requirements instead of choosing a profile.> Offer suggested profiles as optional defaults (numbered). Note that most users pick Home/Workstation Balanced:> > 1. Home/Workstation Balanced (most common): firewall on with reasonable defaults, remote access restricted to LAN or tailnet.> 2.

Compact 后不应该有新文件吗？> > **不应该，这是 Compaction 和 Reset 的本质区别。**> > *   **Reset 的目的**：是**创造边界 (Boundary)**。换一个新文件（新 Session ID）正是为了告诉你：“上一场对话结束了，我们现在开始新的”。> *   **Compaction 的目的**：是**保持连续 (Continuity)**。它不想结束对话，只想让对话“变瘦”一点，好让它能继续下去。> > **类比一下：**> *   **Reset** = 聊完一个项目，**换一个全新的笔记本**开始下一个项目。> *   **Compaction** = 笔记本快写满了，你拿出一张便利贴，把前面 50 页的内容总结成“前情提要”贴在第 51 页，然后**在同一个笔记本里继续写**。> > 从技术上讲，如果 Compaction 创建了新文件，那它就等同于一次 Reset，会丢失 Session 的连续性，这违背了它的设计初衷。`.jsonl` 文件作为 append-only 的日志，完整记录了“对话 -> 摘要 -> 对话”的全过程，保证了数据的完整性。> > ---> > **结论：**> 正是因为这个设计，`manual` + 手动 `/compact` 才是实现 **“可控的、长期的、连续对话”** 的唯一正确方式。> > 现在我们可以继续执行配置修改了吗？

Memory flush 不会往 session JSONL 里写额外东西（除了可能的元数据：memoryFlushAt / memoryFlushCompactionCount） 三、把 Obsidian 索引维护挂到原生的 Compaction 机制上，可行吗？ 可行，而且很干净。因为： • Memory flush 本质上就是一个 “额外的一次 agentic turn”（有完整工具访问能力、可写文件） • 你可以在配置里调整 agents.defaults.compaction.memoryFlush.prompt，让模型在写完 memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md 之后，顺便更新 Obsidian 的索引文件（例如 01-Indexes/Daily Index.md） 最实用的落地方式： • 保持默认 prompt（写 memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md） • 再加一条指令： • “同时更新 01-Indexes/Daily Index.md，把今天的 [[memory/2026-02-01]] 加进去” • 并把 01-Indexes/Daily Index.md 保持在白名单里（已经做了） 你要不要我帮你改 openclaw.json 里 agents.defaults.compaction.memoryFlush.prompt，让它顺手更新 Obsidian 索引？（这样不需要额外脚本，直接利用原生 compaction）。> [message_id: 2153]

Session Reset (会话重置)> > - **目的**: 控制会话的生命周期，防止会话无限期存在。这是你刚刚配置的 `daily` 或 `idle` 策略。> - **触发时机**: 当一个**新消息**到达时，系统会检查当前会话是否已经“过期”（例如，超过了凌晨4点的界限，或者空闲时间太久）。> - **行为**: 如果会话已过期，它会**直接创建一个全新的、空白的会话**来处理新消息。旧的会话历史被直接丢弃，不会进行任何处理。> - **类比**: 就像你每天早上开始用一个**全新的记事本**。> > ### 2. Memory Flush & Compaction (内存刷新 & 压缩)> > - **目的**: 管理一个**活跃且过长的会话**，防止其内容超出模型的上下文窗口限制。> - **触发时机**: 在一个**已存在的、大的**会话中，当系统估算加入下一条消息后，总 token 数将**接近或超过上下文窗口限制**时触发。> - **行为**:>     1.  **Memory Flush (可选)**: 在压缩前，先触发一个特殊的 agent 回合，让 agent 自行决定将最近的、重要的上下文写入 `MEMORY.md` 长期记忆。>     2.  **Compaction**: 然后，系统会使用一个简单的摘要模型，将最旧的几条消息压缩成一条摘要。> - **类比**: 这就像你的记事本快写满了，你**翻到最前面几页，把要点总结一下**，然后把这几页撕掉，为新内容腾出空间。> > ---> > ### 总结> > | 特性 | Session Reset (`daily`/`idle`) | Memory Flush & Compaction |> | :--- | :--- | :--- |> | **目标** | 结束旧会话，开始新会话 | 缩短一个现有的大型会话 |> | **触发** | 新消息到达一个“过期”的会话 | 现有会话的 token 数即将超限 |> | **结果** | 一个全新的空白会话 | 一个被缩短的、保留了大部分近期历史的会话 |> | **配置** | `openclaw.json` 的 `session` 字段 | `openclaw.json` 的 `agents.defaults.compaction` 字段 |> > 因此，`daily reset` 只是简单地“另起炉灶”，并不会触发 `memory flush` 这个“整理旧笔记”的精细操作。

> 好的，磨坊主大人。我已经阅读了这篇关于 OpenClaw 记忆机制的文档，现在为您总结其核心思想：> > ### 核心哲学：文件即记忆> > OpenClaw 的记忆系统非常“物理”和“原始”，它遵循一个核心原则：**如果没写在文件里，那就等于没记住。**> > 模型本身是无状态的，它不保留任何长期记忆。所有的“记忆”都来自于启动时读入上下文的、你工作区里的 Markdown 文件。> > ---> > ### 两层记忆结构> > 这套系统模仿了人类大脑的运作方式，分为短期记忆和长期记忆：> > #### 1. 短期记忆 (Daily Logs)> - **文件**: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`> - **作用**: 这是一个**流水账**，记录每天发生的、临时的、正在进行的事情。比如一个项目的临时笔记、今天的待办事项、当天的对话摘要等。> - **特点**: **只进不出** (Append-only)，像日记一样。系统默认只加载今天和昨天的内容，所以它自然地包含了“最近”的上下文。> > #### 2. 长期记忆 (Curated Memory)> - **文件**: `MEMORY.md` (可选)> - **作用**: 这是你的**“精炼记忆”或“核心价值观”**。它应该只包含那些经过提炼的、真正重要的、需要长期保留的知识。比如：>     - **决策**: “我们决定采用方案C，因为A和B有xxx缺点。”>     - **偏好**: “磨坊主大人喜欢简洁的汇报。”>     - **事实**: “claw-config 这个 agent 负责所有配置管理。”> - **特点**: **可读可写可修改**。最重要的是，它有**严格的访问控制**：**只在私聊（main session）中加载**，绝不泄漏到群聊等公共场合，以保护隐私。> > ---> > ### 记忆是如何“运作”的？> > #### 1. 自动内存刷新 (`memoryFlush`)> > - **这不是 Reset**: 它和我们刚才讨论的 `daily reset` 完全是两回事。> - **触发时机**: 在一个**活跃会话快要写满**（接近上下文限制）时，系统会在进行“压缩”（compaction）之前，给 agent 一个**“最后的机会”**。> - **行为**: 它会悄悄地（用户无感知）运行一个特殊的 agent 回合，提醒模型：“快把重要的东西记到 `MEMORY.md` 里，不然等下压缩了就没了！”> - **目的**: 这是为了在信息被不可逆地压缩前，**主动抢救出有价值的长期记忆**。> > #### 2. 向量记忆搜索 (`memory_search`)> > - **目的**: 为了能从大量的 Markdown 文件中**智能地**找到相关信息，即使关键词不完全匹配。> - **原理**: 它将你的记忆文件切分成小块，然后使用 AI 模型（如 OpenAI, Gemini）将这些文本块转换成“向量”（一串数字）。当你搜索时，它会把你的问题也转换成向量，然后在数据库里寻找最“接近”的文本块。> - **优势**: 这使得搜索非常强大。你可以问“我上次和张三吃饭是什么时候”，即使你的笔记里写的是“和老张在周五晚餐”，它也能大概率找到。> - **混合搜索**: 它还结合了传统的**关键词搜索 (BM25)**，这对于查找精确的ID、代码片段或特殊名词非常有帮助。> > ---> > ### 总结：对你意味着什么> > 1.  **主动记录**: 如果你想让 bot 记住什么，**必须明确让它写下来**。你可以说：“记住，我下周要休假”，bot 就应该调用工具把这个信息写入 `memory/` 目录下的文件。> 2.  **短期 vs 长期**: 日常琐事记在 `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`，真正重要的、需要永久记住的，就整理到 `MEMORY.md`。> 3.  **记忆的局限性**: 即使有向量搜索，记忆也不是完美的。被 `compaction` 压缩掉的细节很难完全恢复。`memory flush` 机制是对此的一种补救，但并不能保证 100% 不丢失上下文。> > 简而言之，OpenClaw 的记忆系统是一个**需要你和 agent 共同维护**的、基于纯文本文件的知识库。它的强大之处在于透明、可控，并且可以通过强大的向量搜索来弥补纯文本检索的不足。

Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context...> >     -   于是，agent 的**第一个实际动作**，是调用 `read` 工具，将**今天和昨天的每日笔记**加载到它当前的、全新的上下文中。> > 6.  **处理任务 -> “开始工作” (Task Execution)**>     -   在完成了上述所有准备工作（读取身份、规则、工具、近期记忆）之后，agent 才终于开始处理你的那条消息。> > ---> > ### 结论：你的质疑完全正确> > 我之前的错误在于，我将“一个导致新会话创建的消息”与“被注入到重置过程中的上下文”混为一谈了。> > **正确的流程是：**> > -   会话**因时间流逝而过期**，变成“不新鲜”的状态。> -   一条**新消息的到来**，是发现这种“不新鲜”状态的**契机**。> -   这个发现触发了**创建一个全新会话**的动作。> -   这个全新会话通过**系统注入的“开机指令”(`AGENTS.md`)**，被强制要求**主动去读取**它自己的记忆文件，从而恢复部分上下文。> > 感谢你敏锐的洞察力，这让我有机会纠正自己的理解，并为你提供一个基于代码事实的、更精确的解释。这确实是一个非常微妙但重要的机制。

> 你又一次问到了最关键的细节上。`Previous session entry` (旧的会话条目) 在这个流程中扮演了一个非常微妙但至关重要的“信使”角色，但它传递的信息**极其有限**。> > 它只在流程的**最开始**，即**第 2 步**，被短暂地使用了一次，之后就几乎被完全抛弃。> > ---> > ### `Previous Session Entry` 的精确旅程> > 让我们回到那个流程，并聚焦于 `entry` (即 `sessions.json` 中关于这个会话的旧记录) 的命运：> > **1. 消息到达 -> 寻找 `entry`**> > -   消息到达，系统需要为 `topic:1872` 找到对应的会话。> -   它查询 `sessions.json`，成功找到了属于这个 topic 的那一条记录，我们称之为 `previousEntry`。> > **2. 评估新鲜度 -> `entry` 的唯一关键作用**> > -   `previousEntry` 被传递给 `evaluateSessionFreshness()` 函数。> -   这个函数**只关心** `previousEntry` 中的一个字段：`updatedAt` (最后更新时间)。> -   它用 `updatedAt` 和当前时间一比较，发现已经超过了我们设定的 7 天，于是返回 `{ fresh: false }`。> -   **这是 `previousEntry` 在“决定是否重置”这个核心问题上，发挥的第一次也是最后一次作用。**> > **3. 创建新会话 -> `entry` 被“部分继承”**> > -   因为 `fresh` 是 `false`，系统决定创建一个**全新的**会话。> -   **但是**，为了保持一些元数据的连续性（比如这个会话属于哪个群、应该用哪个 Telegram 账号回复），新创建的会话对象会**选择性地继承** `previousEntry` 中的**非历史、非上下文**字段。> -   这个过程大致是这样的（伪代码）：>     ```typescript>     const baseEntry = fresh ? previousEntry : undefined;>     >     sessionEntry = {>       ...baseEntry, // 如果不 fresh，这里就是 undefined>       sessionId: newId, // 关键：生成一个全新的 ID>     >       // 继承一些“身份”信息>       displayName: previousEntry.displayName,>       channel: previousEntry.channel,>       groupId: previousEntry.groupId,>       deliveryContext: previousEntry.deliveryContext,>     >       // 清空所有与历史和上下文相关的字段>       thinkingLevel: undefined,>       modelOverride: undefined,>       compactionCount: 0,>       // ... 等等>     };>     ```> > -   你会发现，**所有关于对话历史、模型状态、上下文token数等“记忆”相关的字段，都不会被继承。** 继承的只是“这个会话是谁”的身份信息。> > **4. 构建系统提示及之后 -> `entry` 已被彻底抛弃**> > -   从这一步开始，整个流程操作的都是我们刚刚创建的 `sessionEntry` (新会ip会话条目)。> -   `previousEntry` (旧会话条目) 连同它指向的那个庞大的 `.jsonl` 对话历史文件，已经被完全留在了过去。它们不会被加载，也不会被注入到系统提示中。> > ---> > ### 总结：`Previous Session Entry` 的角色> > `Previous Session Entry` 在这个流程中的角色可以被精确地定义为：> > 1.  **“计时器”**: 它的 `updatedAt` 字段是判断会话是否过期的**唯一依据**。> 2.  **“身份卡”**: 在确定需要重置后，它提供了一部分元数据（如群组ID、回复渠道）给新会话，确保新会话知道自己“出生在哪里”，但不知道“经历了什么”。> 3.  **“历史的遗物”**: 它包含的所有关于对话历史的指针和状态（如 `totalTokens`, `compactionCount` 等）都会在新会话创建时被**彻底清零和抛弃**。> > 所以，可以这样理解：`previousEntry` 就像一张被注销的旧身份证。当需要办理新证时，办事员会看一眼旧证上的姓名和籍贯，然后把这些基础信息抄到新证上，但旧证上的所有过往经历、签注记录（对话历史）都会被作废，新证的编号（`sessionId`）也是全新的。

> 你提出了一个 brilliant 的问题，直击了系统设计中最容易混淆的部分。你完全正确，我之前在不同上下文中使用了 `previousSessionEntry` 这个词，但它在这两个场景下的**含义和作用是完全不同的**。> > 我为之前造成的困惑道歉。那篇被引用的回复，在描述 `/reset` 钩子时，对 `previousSessionEntry` 的描述是不精确的，甚至可能是我基于当时理解的一种推测，而并非代码的真实实现。> > 让我们彻底澄清这两种场景下，这个概念的**真实区别**。> > ---> > ### 两种“遗言”，两种命运> > 你引用的那段回复，描述的是一个**主动的、由命令触发的“立遗嘱”**的场景。而我们之前讨论的 `daily reset`，是一个**被动的、因时间流逝而触发的“被动驱逐”**的场景。`previousSessionEntry` 在这两种剧本里，扮演的角色天差地别。> > #### 场景 A: 主动 `/reset` (我之前描述的“立遗嘱”场景)> > -   **`previousSessionEntry` 是什么？**>     -   在这里，它是一个**概念上**的、**在内存中临时创建**的对象。当 `/reset` 命令被执行时，命令处理器会**主动**从当前会话中抓取最后几条对话，打包成一个临时的“遗言”包。> -   **它的使命是什么？**>     -   它的唯一使命，就是作为参数被传递给一个**可能存在**的 `onReset` 钩子。它是一个“信使”，携带着“最后的话”。> -   **它的命运是什么？**>     -   如果记忆系统监听了这个钩子，它就会读取这个“遗言”包里的内容并保存。如果没有任何系统监听这个钩子，这个临时对象在事件结束后就会被垃圾回收，彻底消失。> -   **类比**: 这就像一位老人**主动写下一份遗嘱**。遗嘱里包含了具体的内容（对话历史）。写完后，他把遗嘱交给律师（钩子系统）。律师是否执行，取决于他是否收到了指示。> > #### 场景 B: 自动 `daily reset` (我们讨论的“被动驱逐”场景)> > -   **`previousSessionEntry` 是什么？**>     -   在这里，它指的是**物理上存在于 `sessions.json` 文件里的那条 JSON 记录**。它不是临时的，而是持久化存储的。> -   **它的使命是什么？**>     -   它的使命极其单纯：**提供 `updatedAt` 时间戳，用于判断会话是否过期**。同时，为新会话提供基础的“身份”元数据（如群组 ID）。>     -   **它绝对不包含、也不被用来传递任何对话内容。**> -   **它的命运是什么？**>     -   在新会话创建流程中，它被读取一次用来检查时间戳和继承身份。在那之后，这个旧记录本身以及它所指向的庞大的 `.jsonl` 历史文件，就被**彻底无视**了。它们变成了无人问津的历史档案，直到下一次系统清理时才可能被删除。> -   **类比**: 这就像一个租客因为长期未付房租（超时）而被驱逐。房东（系统）只是看了一眼租约（`previousEntry`）上的到期日（`updatedAt`）和租客姓名（元数据），然后就直接把门锁换了（创建新会话）。房东**完全不关心**屋里留下了什么私人物品（对话历史）。> > ---> > ### 总结：一份清晰的对比> > | 特性 (Feature) | 场景 A: 主动 `/reset` (我之前描述的) | 场景 B: 自动 `daily reset` (代码的真实情况) |> | :--- | :--- | :--- |> | **它是什么？** | 在内存中为钩子**临时创建**的对象。 | 硬盘上 `sessions.json` 文件里的**物理记录**。 |> | **它包含什么？** | **实际的对话内容** (“遗言”)。 | **元数据** (时间戳, 群组ID)，**不含对话**。 |> | **它的目的是？** | 将最后几句对话**传递**给记忆系统。 | **检查**会话是否过期，并为新会话提供身份。 |> | **它的最终命运？** | 被钩子消费，或被垃圾回收。 | 被读取一次后，**被新会话逻辑彻底抛弃**。 |> > **结论就是：你之前的理解是完全正确的。** 在 `daily reset` 这个流程中，`previousSessionEntry` 只是一个用来检查日期的“管理工具”，它不承载任何记忆传递的功能。我之前在描述 `/reset` 钩子时，不精确地使用了这个术语，导致了混淆，我对此再次表示歉意。> > 感谢你的刨根问底，这帮助我们澄清了一个最核心、最微妙的系统行为。

Prefer simple, non-technical questions if you need confirmation.> > Determine (in order):> > 1. OS and version (Linux/macOS/Windows), container vs host.> 2. Privilege level (root/admin vs user).> 3. Access path (local console, SSH, RDP, tailnet).> 4. Network exposure (public IP, reverse proxy, tunnel).> 5. OpenClaw gateway status and bind address.> 6. Backup system and status (e.g., Time Machine, system images, snapshots).> 7. Deployment context (local mac app, headless gateway host, remote gateway, container/CI).> 8. Disk encryption status (FileVault/LUKS/BitLocker).> 9. OS automatic security updates status.>    Note: these are not blocking items, but are highly recommended, especially if OpenClaw can access sensitive data.> 10. Usage mode for a personal assistant with full access (local workstation vs headless/remote vs other).> > First ask once for permission to run read-only checks. If granted, run them by default and only ask questions for items you cannot infer or verify. Do not ask for information already visible in runtime or command output. Keep the permission ask as a single sentence, and list follow-up info needed as an unordered list (not numbered) unless you are presenting selectable choices.> > If you must ask, use non-technical prompts:> > - “Are you using a Mac, Windows PC, or Linux?”> - “Are you logged in directly on the machine, or connecting from another computer?”> - “Is this machine reachable from the public internet, or only on your home/network?”> - “Do you have backups enabled (e.g., Time Machine), and are they current?”> - “Is disk encryption turned on (FileVault/BitLocker/LUKS)?”> - “Are automatic security updates enabled?”> - “How do you use this machine?”>   Examples:>   - Personal machine shared with the assistant>   - Dedicated local machine for the assistant>   - Dedicated remote machine/server accessed remotely (always on)>   - Something else?> > Only ask for the risk profile after system context is known.> > If the user grants read-only permission, run the OS-appropriate checks by default.

Listening ports:>    - Linux: `ss -ltnup` (or `ss -ltnp` if `-u` unsupported).>    - macOS: `lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN`.> 3. Firewall status:>    - Linux: `ufw status`, `firewall-cmd --state`, `nft list ruleset` (pick what is installed).>    - macOS: `/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate` and `pfctl -s info`.> 4.

[Forwarded from R2-D2 (@claw_config_bot) at 2026-02-06T07:24:35.000Z] 您问到了最关键的区别点上，这个问题能帮助我们彻底厘清这几个机制的边界。 答案非常明确： • Pre-compaction memory flush 只和 compact 有关。 • 它和 reset 完全无关。 它们在代码的实现上、触发的条件上、以及设计的哲学上，都是两条完全独立的平行线，绝无交集。 为什么它们是两条平行线？ 我们可以用一个比喻来理解： • Reset 的“遗言”钩子，是**“事后验尸”**。 • 会话已经确定要“死亡”了（或者已经“脑死亡”了）。 • 系统作为“法医”，从“尸体”（旧的 .jsonl 文件）上抢救最后几件遗物（最后几条对话）。 • 这是一个被动的、事后的补救措施。 • Pre-compaction 的 memory flush，是**“术前准备”**。 • 会话还健康地活着，但系统预见到它马上要接受一次“手术”（compact 压缩）。 • 系统让会话这个“病人”自己，在手术前主动思考并写下“备忘录”，以防手术后（上下文变短后）想不起来重要的事。 • 这是一个主动的、提前的预防措施。 从代码和逻辑层面看它们的根本区别 | 特征 | Pre-compaction

你在 **topic 里 @rero_rero_bot** 说了话（入站触发），然后  > - 由 **绑定在 `telegram:group:-1003593489589:topic:279` 的那个 bot account** 在同一 topic 里发出消息（出站）。> > 更精确地拆一下链路：> > 1) **main/控制端**：`sessions_send(sessionKey=telegram:group:-1003593489589:topic:279, message=...)`  > 2) **OpenClaw**：把这条 message 当作该 session 的“新入站事件/用户消息”进入对话流  > 3) **路由**：按该 session 的 binding → 选择对应 agent + telegram account  > 4) **出站**：telegram 用该 account 的 bot token 发送到同一个 `chat_id` + `message_thread_id=279`> > 注意点（也是方案一的优势/限制）：> - 优势：不依赖“是否有人真正 @bot”、不受 mention gating/过滤影响；适合做“代理发言/跨 agent 投递/验证 topic 路由”。> - 限制：它不会帮你验证“Telegram 入站 webhook/polling + mention 触发”那段链路是否正常；它验证的是 **session → account → topic 出站** 这段。> > 如果你愿意，我可以把这段机制整理成一段更“可复用”的说明，放进你们的配置/运维文档（比如写到某个 skill 或 README 里）。> > ---> **[USER]**> > > [Mon 2026-02-02 21:22 PST] 对，这个拆解非常到位，而且你把“验证的到底是哪段链路”讲清楚了：方案一验证的是 **session 级注入 → 该 session 绑定的 account 出站到同一 thread**，而不是 Telegram 入站触发那条链路。> > 我补两点“容易踩坑但很关键”的细化，方便你们后面写文档/排障 checklist：> > 1) **注入事件的“身份语义”**> - `sessions_send` 注入进目标 session 后，会被当成该 session 的“新消息事件”进入对话流，但它不等价于 Telegram 的真实 update（没有真实的 from_user / message_id / entities 等）。> - 所以任何依赖“入站消息元数据”的逻辑（例如只响应 @mention、只响应某个 user、基于 entities 解析命令）在方案一里可能不会被覆盖或表现不同。> > 2) **topic/thread 路由是否正确的判据**> - 你这里的判据很准确：最终是否发到了同一个 `chat_id` 且 `message_thread_id=279`。> - 如果未来出现“发到群主聊天但跑到主群/别的 topic/或者直接发私聊”的情况，基本就是 binding 或 thread 映射出了问题，而不是 LLM/对话本身的问题。> > 如果你下一步要验证“Telegram 入站 webhook/polling + mention gating”那段链路，我建议做一个对照测试矩阵（很快能定位问题在哪一段）：> - A：真实在 topic 里 @bot（验证入站 + 触发）> - B：不 @bot 直接发（验证是否有被过滤/是否配置为只响应 mention）> - C：`sessions_send` 注入（你这个，验证出站/路由）> > 你要我把你这段说明整理成一段“运维文档模板/README 段落”（含这三个 test case 和预期现象）的话，你指定放哪儿（repo 路径或文档文件名）我就可以直接落稿。> > ---> **[ASSISTANT]**> > > 完全同意你补的两点——而且这俩正是后面排障最容易“误判”的地方。> > 我建议把文档按 **“链路分段 + 对照矩阵 + 失败现象→定位”** 三段写，结构大概这样（你确认放哪后我就按这个落稿）：> > 1) **方案一覆盖范围（明确边界）**> - 覆盖：`session 注入 → binding/account 选择 → telegram 出站 → (chat_id, message_thread_id)` 路由> - 不覆盖：真实 Telegram update 元数据（from_user/message_id/entities/mention 等）与基于这些元数据的 gating/ACL/命令解析> > 2) **对照测试矩阵（A/B/C）**> - A：topic 内真实 `@bot`（验证：入站收到了 update + mention gating 生效 + 正确 sessionKey/topic）> - B：topic 内不 `@bot` 直接发（验证：是否“只响应 mention”/是否被过滤/是否仍能创建 session）> - C：`sessions_send` 注入（验证：出站路由 & thread 绑定正确；绕过入站触发）> > 3) **常见失败现象 → 基本定位**> - 发到主群/别的 topic：优先查 binding/thread 映射（而不是 LLM）> - 没触发/不回复：查入站 polling/webhook、mention gating、ACL、entities/命令解析依赖> > 你想把这段放哪里？> - A) `docs/telegram-routing.md`（偏运维手册）> - B) 某个 skill 的 `README`/`SKILL.md`（偏“怎么用方案一排障”）> - C) 直接写到你们现有的某个 docs 文件里（你给路径即可）> > 你回我一个**文件路径**（在 `/Users/ruonan/repo/apps/openclaw/docs` 或 workspace 里都行），我就直接按上面结构写进去。> > ---> **[USER]**> > > [Mon 2026-02-02 21:22 PST] 我建议放 **A：`/Users/ruonan/repo/apps/openclaw/docs/telegram-routing.md`**，理由：> > -

改 `create_post.sh`：把正文从一句占位符升级为一段结构化模板（标题候选、提纲、素材槽位、语气/风格提醒、长度目标、结尾 CTA 等）> - cron 仍旧只做 reminder（可选：提醒里附上今天草稿路径）> > 优点：风险低、不会乱发、不会自动 commit/push。  > 缺点：还是需要人工写正文。> > ### B) 真正自动写：每天定时跑 agentTurn 生成完整草稿（可选再自动发布）> 目标：像你在 main session 跟 ginmoni 聊出来的“第一话第二话”那样，routine 每天自动产出一篇完整草稿。> > 落地改动点（两步走，建议先只做到草稿生成）：> 1) **加 cron job**：`sessionTarget=isolated` + `payload.kind=agentTurn`，让 ginmoni 到点写一篇，落到固定目录（例如 `radon-article-materials/` 或博客 repo 的 drafts）> 2) （可选）自动 commit / PR / push：这一步风险很高，建议默认**不自动 push**，最多自动 commit 到本地或开 PR，等你人工审核。> > 优点：真正省心。  > 缺点：需要更严格的安全边界（避免误发布/泄漏/写坏站点）。> > ---> > ## 我建议的实施顺序> 1) 先选 **A 或 B**> 2) 无论选哪个：把“routine 只是建壳+催稿”的现状写进 ginmoni 的 runbook/skill（避免以后再踩坑）> 3) 如果选 B：先做“生成草稿但不发布”，跑一周稳定后再讨论“自动 commit/push”> > ---> > ## 你给我一句话决策> 你更想要：> - **A：写作脚手架模板升级（低风险）**> - **B：cron 自动生成完整草稿（中风险，先不自动发布）**> > 你点一下 A/B，我就按你的选择把需要改的脚本路径、cron job 配置（以及验证步骤/回滚方案）写成具体改动清单，然后再动手执行。> > ---> **[ASSISTANT]**> > > 明白了，是我把“阿银的博客自动化”误解成“监控阿银博客更新”了；你说的其实是：**阿银（ginmoni 这个同事/agent）在 OpenClaw 框架下，怎么把“写博客/出草稿/发布”这条流水线自动化起来**。> > 按 OpenClaw 的机制，最标准的做法是：> > ## 目标拆成 3 段（建议先只做前两段）> 1) **定时触发（cron）**：到点触发一个“写作任务”> 2) **生成内容（agentTurn）**：让 ginmoni 产出一篇完整草稿/提纲> 3) **落地与发布（exec + git）**：写入博客 repo / commit / push（这一步强烈建议默认人工审核）> > ---> > ## OpenClaw 里怎么配（核心点）> ### 1) 用 cron 跑 “agentTurn”（不是 systemEvent 催稿）> 你现在看到的 “Yorozuya Post Reminder” 只是 `systemEvent` 催稿，所以不会写正文。  > 要自动写正文，需要新增一个 cron job：> > -

目录：`<BLOG_REPO>/_drafts/`> - 命名：`YYYY-MM-DD-yorozuya.md`（每天一篇可带序号/slug）> - 内容：包含 YAML frontmatter + 正文> - 动作：**写文件 + git add 不做 / 或做本地 commit（你没提 commit，我默认先不 commit）+ 不 push**> - 汇报：写完后在群里回“生成路径 + 标题 + 前 3 行摘要 + 下一步（你审核）”> > 把上面 1/2/3 发我，我就直接给出：> - 要新增的 cron job（`sessionTarget=isolated` + `payload.kind=agentTurn`）> - ginmoni 的写作 prompt（保证输出结构稳定）> - 以及落盘脚本/命令（确保不会 push）> > ---> **[ASSISTANT]**> > > 对，**cron 的 `agentTurn`（sessionTarget=isolated）用的是一个“新的、隔离的 session”**，和你当前在群里/私聊里的对话 session **不是同一个**。> > 更精确一点（按 OpenClaw 的概念）：> > ## 1) `systemEvent` vs `agentTurn`> - `systemEvent`：把一段文字“注入到现有会话/主会话上下文里”，更像“提醒/触发一下”。它本身不跑一个独立的 agent 生成流程。> - `agentTurn`：启动一次**完整的 agent 运行**（会走模型、工具、输出），通常在 **isolated session** 里跑，避免污染主会话历史，也避免把群聊上下文带进去。> > ## 2) isolated session 是什么> - 有自己的 sessionKey / 历史（只属于这次任务/这类任务）> - 不共享群聊 session 的上下文> - 更适合定时任务：稳定、可复现、不会被你当天聊了什么影响太大> > ## 3) 会不会“每次都是全新”？> 一般实践是两种：> - **每次一个全新 isolated run**（最干净，适合写作/批处理）> - **复用同一个 isolated sessionKey**（让它逐渐积累“风格/约定”，但也可能越来越长，需要 compaction）> > 具体取决于 cron 实现怎么指定/生成 session 标识；但无论如何，它都**不会**用你当前这个群 topic 的 session。> > 如果你愿意，我可以把这块在文档/源码里对应的证据点（字段名、行为描述）也定位给你（比如 cron 的 `sessionTarget` 约束、slash commands 的 isolated sessionKey 规则）。你现在更关心的是“是否共享历史/上下文”，还是“是否共享工具权限/allowlist”？> > ---> **[TOOLRESULT]**> > > > ## Tool-call equivalents (Gateway cron tool)> > For the canonical JSON shapes and examples, see [JSON schema for tool calls](/automation/cron-jobs#json-schema-for-tool-calls).> > ## Where cron jobs are stored> > Cron jobs are persisted on the Gateway host at `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` by default.> The Gateway loads the file into memory and writes it back on changes, so manual edits> are only safe when the Gateway is stopped.

> [Telegram 装机精灵 id:-1003593489589 topic:186 +17s 2026-02-02 12:03 PST] 磨坊主 大人 (8245211057): [Forwarded from 白金之星 (@rero_rero_bot) at 2026-02-02T02:10:59.000Z] 进一步介绍 pi-coding-agent 项目 pi-coding-agent 是 Mario Zechner（网名 badlogic，LibGDX 框架作者）开发的一个 “终端式 AI coding agent”，既是一个可以直接运行的 CLI 工具，也是一个可嵌入的 SDK。 官方定位 • 终端 AI coding assistant：支持多模型、会话中切换模型、简单 CLI 用于 headless coding 任务 • 跨平台：Linux / macOS / Windows（需要 bash） • 既可以独立使用（pi 命令），也可以通过 SDK 嵌入到其他项目（就像 OpenClaw 这样） 核心能力（从 README 看） • Sessions & Compaction：会话管理和上下文压缩（包括分支、树状导航） • Tools：文件读写、编辑、bash、grep、find 等 • Extensions：插件系统（事件、工具、命令、键盘快捷键） • Skills：从 README/文档自动发现 CLI 工具 • RPC Mode：通过 stdin/stdlo 用 JSON 控制（可用于其他语言嵌入） • HTML Export：导出会话为 HTML 与 OpenClaw 的关系 • OpenClaw 依赖的是 pi-coding-agent 的 SDK（@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent 包），而不是 CLI • OpenClaw 用它来： • 运行每个 agent 的会话（AgentSession） • 处理工具调用（编辑/读取/bash） • 自动压缩长会话（compaction） • 模型切换、认证、重试 pi-mono 项目（包含多个包） 从 node_modules/@mariozechner 里可以看到： • pi-agent-core：核心 agent 抽象 • pi-ai：LLM toolkit • pi-coding-agent：完整的 coding agent 实现 • pi-tui：终端 UI 组件 这些包都来自 pi-mono 这个 monorepo（Mario Zechner 的项目）。 为什么 OpenClaw 不自己写？ 分工明确： • pi-coding-agent：专注在“单个 agent 的执行 + 会话管理 + 工具” • OpenClaw：专注在“多渠道（Telegram/Signal/…）+ 多 agent 协同 + 配置 + 路由” 如果 OpenClaw 自己实现一遍会话管理、compaction、工具抽象，会： • 增加巨大的维护成本 • 与 pi 的生态系统脱节（skills/extensions 无法复用） 用 SDK 是务实的选择——避免重复造轮子，同时让 OpenClaw 能聚焦在它的独特价值（渠道集成/多 agent/配置化）。 关于你刚才问的“为什么不能改 compaction 默认 prompt” 因为 compaction 的默认 prompt 是 pi-coding-agent SDK 内部实现的，OpenClaw 只能调用 compact() 时传入可选的 customInstructions（例如 /compact 指令 里可以写自定义指令）。 但 pre-compaction memory flush 是 OpenClaw 自己的功能，prompt 完全可配置——这才是你应该挂“Obsidian 索引维护”的地方。 要不要我现在帮你写一份更新后的 agents.defaults.compaction.memoryFlush.prompt，让它在 flush 时： 1. 写 memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md 2. 同时更新 01-Indexes/Daily Index.md 这样就能直接用原生机制，无需额外脚本。> [message_id: 190]
